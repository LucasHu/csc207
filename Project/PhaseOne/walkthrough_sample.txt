Note to students in Diane's class: A scenario walk-through involves thinking
through the steps that would be required to carry out one of the scenarios
that the software is designed to handle. It serves as a test case for your
design, often revealing gaps and shortcomings in the design, which of course
you should address until you find no more.

In lecture, we did a scenario walk-through verbally, but didn't write it down.
The format shown here is consistent with how we talked about it, and is how
we'd like you to write your walk-through for Phase I.
